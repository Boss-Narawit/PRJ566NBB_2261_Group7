# ReDrobe
A smart digital wardrobe platform that helps users reduce fashion waste, reduce impulse spending, and maximize their existing wardrobe.

## Brief summary

ReDrobe is a comprehensive digital wardrobe management platform designed
to reduce fashion waste, curb impulsive spending, and optimize personal style. Users digitally
catalog their clothing, track usage, create and manage outfits, and receive intelligent reminders
about underutilized items. The platform integrates a “thoughtful purchasing” feature that
combats impulse buys through a timed consideration period and similarity checks against
existing items.With clear data visualizations and an annual Style Recap, ReDrobe turns daily
habits into insights, while a community board, marketplace integration, and an AI stylist chatbot
help users find new outfit ideas and give unused clothing a second life through resale, donation,
or upcycling.

## Problem
Most people own far more clothes than they actually wear, leading to wasted money, impulsive purchases, and unnecessary environmental harm. Existing wardrobe apps focus on organization, but fail to discourage overconsumption or provide insights on clothing usage.

## Solution
ReDrobe is an all-in-one digital wardrobe management platform that allows users to:
- Digitally catalog their clothing
- Track wear frequency
- Create and save outfits
- Receive reminders for underutilized items
- Prevent impulse purchases through a built-in “cooling-off” system
- Gain insights through analytics and an annual “Style Recap”
