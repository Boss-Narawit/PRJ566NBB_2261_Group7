# ReDrobe

Brief summary

ReDrobe is a comprehensive digital wardrobe management platform designed
to reduce fashion waste, curb impulsive spending, and optimize personal style. Users digitally
catalog their clothing, track usage, create and manage outfits, and receive intelligent reminders
about underutilized items. The platform integrates a “thoughtful purchasing” feature that
combats impulse buys through a timed consideration period and similarity checks against
existing items.With clear data visualizations and an annual Style Recap, ReDrobe turns daily
habits into insights, while a community board, marketplace integration, and an AI stylist chatbot
help users find new outfit ideas and give unused clothing a second life through resale, donation,
or upcycling.
